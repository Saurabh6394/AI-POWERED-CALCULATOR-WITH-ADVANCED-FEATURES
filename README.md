🚀 **Key Features**
🧠 *AI-Driven Input Understanding*

Natural Language Interpretation: Users can type sentences like “What is the derivative of x² + 3x?” and the system intelligently converts them into symbolic math for evaluation.

Drawing Input Recognition: Handwritten expressions drawn on a canvas are captured, converted to an image, and processed using Google Vision OCR to extract the equation.

Image Upload Support: Snap a photo of handwritten notes or printed equations — the backend converts it into solvable math.
